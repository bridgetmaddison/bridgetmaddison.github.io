					<p>Thank you for taking the time to read through these pages, if you think I may be
the right person to help you with your difficulties, please contact me now, to
arrange a brief informal chat at a mutually agreed time. This will give me a
broad understanding of what you want to work on and whether I can help. It will
also give you the opportunity to ask any questions and get a sense of whether
you feel we can work together before committing to your first appointment.
Feel free to call me, or if you prefer email me a summary of your current
problem and we can take it from there. You can also fill out the contact form

<p>I primarily use <a href="https://doxy.me">Doxy.me</a>, a video communication platform designed for health
care professionals. It is a user friendly system with no requirement for you

interruption.</p>
