					</header>

				<section class="post-content">
					<h2 id="referrals">Referrals</h2>

Health, Aviva, Nuffield Health, and others.</p>
<h2 id="current">Current</h2>
<p>I am an experienced and Accredited (BABCP) Cognitive Behavioural
Psychotherapist and Registered Mental Health Nurse. I have been privileged to
work with many people, empowering them to gain the skills and strategies required
to work through their problems using the CBT model. Research shows that the
success of any Therapy experience is very much dependent on the quality of the
therapeutic relationship. I believe I bring a non-judgemental, warm and kindly
approach to sessions, ensuring you feel safe and supported as we work together.</p>
<p>I have 15 years of experience of working within the NHS, completing my Post
Graduate Qualification in CBT in 2010. Alongside my individual work with Clients I
have enjoyed devising and facilitating an Acceptance and Commitment Therapy
Group Programme (ACT) which continues to run across the County.</p>
<p>Following my decision to leave the NHS in 2018 I will work solely from the Beacon
Clinic from 2019 with individuals from 16 upwards.</p>
<p>I have experience of providing Clinical Supervision within the NHS and externally. I
currently offer Supervision for those interested in building skills within the ACT Model.
This can be face to face or on Doxy.me, Skype, or Zoom.</p>

Pin No. 00E0415E, 2003</li>
<li>Bachelor of Arts (Honours) Open University 1998</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="experience">Experience</h2>

<li>2003: Following completion of my Mental Health Nursing Diploma, I worked on
an Acute Psychiatric Ward in Worcester, prior to moving to a Day Hospital
setting, where I worked with people individually and in groups.</li>
<li>2006: Joined Primary Care Mental Health Service in Worcestershire as a
Gateway Worker (this involved, mental health reviews, using CBT approach

</ul>
<h2 id="code-of-ethics-and-regulation">Code of Ethics and Regulation</h2>
<p>I have a continuing commitment to best practice and regularly attend workshops and
Courses which support my professional development and contribute to my ongoing
Accreditation and Registration. I receive monthly Supervision from an
experienced BABCP Accredited CBT Therapist/ Compassion Focused Therapist. I
also attend a Peer Supervision Group grounded in the ACT model and Contextual
Behavioural Science.</p>
<p>As an Accredited member of the British Association of Behavioural and Cognitive
Therapists and the Nursing and Midwifery Council, my work is underpinned by the
Professional Standards of Conduct and Ethics outlined by these established
organisations. I am also a member of the Association for Contextual and Behavioural
Scientists, which enables me to develop my practice within the ACT model.</p>
<p>I have an Enhanced Disclosure and Barring Service Status</p>
